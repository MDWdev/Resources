##Programming Resources!

The goal of this repo is to collect a mass of online and physical resources for our students here at Grand Circus. Because we believe in the power of Open Source we are opening the repo to the world and letting anyone contribute. For now we will keep all of the resources in this readme file.

**Guidelines**
-Please list specific items rather than general recommendations (i.e. 'you should read this blog').
- Do not list pirated or illicit copies of copyrighted material. Many books are publised for free online, that's fine. For book recommendations which are not available online include a a link to amazon or a kindle page.
